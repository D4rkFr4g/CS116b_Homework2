- In this window, should appear a unit sphere centered at the origin. 

- The view is looking at the origin from 5 units forward on the z-axis, 2 units up in the y direction.(0,2,5) 

- Your sphere should be textured to look cool using a texture that comes from a PNG file (not ppm). 

- Using the l and r keys causes the viewpoint to move left and or right on the circle of radius 5 at the same height. 

- View your sphere as a kind of jack-in-the-box. Hitting the p key repeatedly, scales the y-axis of the sphere, making it more and more of an ellipsoid, until when sy=0.5, it "pops". 

- At this point, a fractal generated plant should appear on top of the sphere. The stem of this plant should make use of a statistically self-similar fractal. Iterated a fixed number of times, at the last step we replace initiator for that step with a flower or nothing with a fixed probability. 

- Hitting the o key lets one step backward through the process of popping to the starting configuration. This completes the description.
